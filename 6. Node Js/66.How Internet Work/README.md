## Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling involves increasing the computing power of a single machine, typically by adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage. This approach is akin to upgrading a computer's hardware to handle more tasks or accommodate higher demands. In the context of internet infrastructure, vertical scaling can be used to enhance the performance of individual servers or components, allowing them to handle larger loads or more intensive tasks.

## Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling, on the other hand, involves adding more machines or nodes to a system to distribute the workload across multiple devices. Rather than relying on a single powerful machine, horizontal scaling leverages the combined resources of multiple smaller machines, known as a cluster or a distributed system. This approach offers better scalability and fault tolerance, as it can accommodate increased demand by simply adding more machines to the network.
